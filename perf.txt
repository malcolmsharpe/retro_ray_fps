    Frame time = 16.7ms

    That's with "-O".

    "-O3": pretty much the same.

    Will now replace silly pixel-by-pixel rendering with drawing entire rects at once.

    Now 2.8ms.

According to profiling, the biggest timesink now is the text rendering.
And that's spent mostly on SDL_DestroyTexture and SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface.
Some helpful suggestions:

Also tried running it in a browser.
In Firefox, it's ~10x slower (~30ms frames).
    And the optimized code crashed, complaining of integer overflow.
In Chrome, much worse than even that (~90ms frames).
